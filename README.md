🔁 Java Control Flow: The Core of Decision-Making
Welcome to the Java Control Flow concept guide! This repository helps you understand how Java programs make decisions, repeat tasks, and control the flow of execution using conditional and looping statements.

📌 What is Control Flow?
Control Flow in Java refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated.

There are three main types:
   1.Sequential – Default execution from top to bottom.
   2.Selection (Decision-making) – Executes code based on conditions.
   3.Iteration (Loops) – Repeats a block of code.
   
🧭 Description: What is Control Flow in Java?
Control Flow in Java refers to the order in which instructions in a program are executed. It determines how the program chooses different paths based on conditions and how it repeats certain operations. By using control flow statements, developers can make decisions, execute code conditionally, and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

There are three main categories of control flow:
  1.Conditional Statements – Used to execute blocks of code based on Boolean expressions. (if, if-else, switch)
  2.Looping Statements – Used to repeat a block of code multiple times. (for, while, do-while)
  3.Jump Statements – Used to alter the normal flow, such as exiting loops early or skipping iterations. (break, continue, return)
  4.Understanding control flow is essential for writing logical, efficient, and dynamic Java applications.
